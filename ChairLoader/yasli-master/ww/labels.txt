Following control character sequences available during serialiazation of data
through PropertyTree (using PropertyI/OArchive-s). Label of the serialized value
should start with sequence of such characters. 

List of characters:
 "&" - [REMOVED] Put value to the "digest" of parent element.
 
 "!" - Read only field. Prevents user from changing value of the field. 
	   Doesn't affect nested members.

 "!!" - Text field looks like read only, but can be changed with F2
 
 "^" - Pull up the row. The row will appear in the same line with parent one, after it's value.
	   Works for containers as well.

 "^^" - Put value of a child element before name of the parent.
 
 "<" - Expand value field to maximal width. Handeful for long fields.
	   label can contain only "<" character, in this case the whole line will
	   be occupied with the value.

 ">" - Set widget size to minimal, it will not resize anymore.
 ">size>" - Set minimal widget width to "size".
 
 "~" - Temporary element (with null Serializer).
 
 "[controls]" - Forward control characters to container elements.

Examples:

	// will bring the Name to the line of parent structure
	ar(name_, "name", "^Name"); 

	// appears as nameless, read-only, full-line value field
	ar(description_, "description", "!<");
